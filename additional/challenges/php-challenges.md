# PHP challenge #

We want to create a database of all the PAX related guides currently available on Guidebook for a case study.

**Challenge:** Create a PHP(5) project that will retrieve a list of guides using the `pax` keyword and insert them into a database.

In this challenge, your project must be Object-Oriented.
The URL used to search for guides is `https://guidebook.com/om/service/v2/search/`. You will have to send a GET parameter `q` with the keyword you want to use to do your research.

A guide object will look like:

```javascript
{
    "startDate":"2014-10-17T00:00:00",
    "endDate":"2014-10-19T00:00:00",
    "landing_url":"/g/WellesleyFamilyandFriendsWeekend",
    "default_venue":"",
    "large_icon":"",
    "id":"22866",
    "icon":"https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.guidebook.com/service/CTnHck9pxbLt7gKu54vN3JoVmjYwhB8r/logo.png",
    "guideVersion":34,
    "gb_url":"gb://redeem/?guideId=22866",
    "minAppVersion-Android":31,
    "name":"Wellesley Family & Friends Weekend and Homecoming 2014",
    "url":"/guide/22866/",
    "venue":{
        "city":"Wellesley",
        "state":"MA",
        "street":"106 Central Street",
        "name":"Wellesley College",
        "zipcode":"02481"
    },
    "productIdentifier":"CTnHck9pxbLt7gKu54vN3JoVmjYwhB8r",
    "bundleVersion":0,
    "minAppVersion-iOS":"30",
    "type":"guide"
}
```

Once you have the list of guides, save them into a database. It could be a good idea to use `PDO` here.
You might have to create several tables but the schema structure is entirely up to you.

You do not need to create the database via PHP but you can if you want. If you don't however, please include the SQL statement used in your archive.

### What We'll Be Looking At ###

We want to make sure that the solution implements OO patterns properly and that the project is structured in a logical manner.
We also want to make sure that your code is clean and commented.
