# Recipe Unit Conversion

Create a script to convert units of measure for recipes. It should take in an amount and a unit (using either `$argv` or `fgets(STDIN)`) and output that amount converted to another unit of measure. You can either output the converted amount in all the relevant units, *or* ask the user what unit they would like to convert it to.
