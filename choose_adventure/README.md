	A.) A Bullet shell
	B.) A Blade
	C.) A Folded Note
	D.) A Fish Wrapper in Paper
	
Be creative with your story or come up with your own. Possibilities are endless: Batman, Robin, Catwoman, Super Man, Spiderman.

Make sure you have 4 options to choose from and give 4 options for each of those options. Eventually selections need to lead to the end of the story. Each options should print a different part of the story to make sense.
