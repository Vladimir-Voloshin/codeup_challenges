# Recipe Scaling

Using your code from the Unit Conversion challenge, create a script to scale the ingredients of an entire recipe. Your script should take in one of the sample recipes provided and allow the user to scale the recipe up or down by a specified amount of:

* 1/4
* 1/3
* 1/2
* 2x
* 3x
* 4x

Make sure to output the simplest unit that makes sense; for example rather than printing "1/3 Tbsp" or "1/4 lb", output "1 tsp" and "4 oz" respectively.
